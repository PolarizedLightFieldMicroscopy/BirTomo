Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 2418025 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 395,425
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 395,425
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 440
		For 5 or more rays: 0
Masking out voxels except for 395425 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([26839, 26840, 26841, 26842, 26843, 26844, 26845, 26846, 26847, 26848,
        26849, 26850, 26851, 26852, 26853, 26854, 26855, 26856, 26857, 26858],
