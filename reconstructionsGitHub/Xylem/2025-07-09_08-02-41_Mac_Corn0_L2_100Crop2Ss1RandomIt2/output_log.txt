Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 366025 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 178,283
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 119,099
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 77,971
		For 5 or more rays: 76,760
Masking out voxels except for 101480 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([2075, 2076, 2077, 2078, 2079, 2080, 2081, 2082, 2083, 2084, 2085, 2086,
