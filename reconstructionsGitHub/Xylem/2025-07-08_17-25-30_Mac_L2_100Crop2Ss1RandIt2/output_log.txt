Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 366025 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 229,345
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 167,594
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 144,639
		For 5 or more rays: 129,947
Masking out voxels except for 94393 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([739, 740, 741, 742, 743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750, 751, 752,
