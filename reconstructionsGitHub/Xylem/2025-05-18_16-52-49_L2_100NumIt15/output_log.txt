Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 570025 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 395,425
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 395,425
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 440
		For 5 or more rays: 0
Masking out voxels except for 395425 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([919, 920, 921, 922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 928, 929, 930, 931, 932,
        933, 934, 935, 936, 937, 938], dtype=torch.int32)
