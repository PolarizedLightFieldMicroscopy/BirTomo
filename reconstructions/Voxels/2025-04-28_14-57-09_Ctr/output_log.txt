Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 3757 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 3,241
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 932
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 3,240
		For 2 or more rays: 3,163
Masking out voxels except for 1 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([1878], dtype=torch.int32)
