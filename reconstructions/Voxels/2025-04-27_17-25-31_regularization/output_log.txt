Initializing a Reconstructor, using computing device cpu
Omitting rays based on pixels with zero retardance.
For raytracing, using computing device cpu
Raytracing time in seconds: 0.06
Preparing rays for all rays at once...
Prepared geometry for all rays at once.
No radiometry provided for filtering rays.
Saving rays...
Rays saved in 0 seconds to ../reconstructions/Voxels/2025-04-27_17-25-31_regularization/config_parameters/rays.pkl
Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 3757 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 3,241
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 1,414
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 3,238
		For 2 or more rays: 3,162
Masking out voxels except for 3 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([1876, 1878, 1880], dtype=torch.int32)
Voxel mask created in 0.13 seconds
Using retardance and azimuth images for data-fidelity term.
Reconstructor initialized in 0.22 seconds
