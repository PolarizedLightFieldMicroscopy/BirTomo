Initializing a Reconstructor, using computing device cpu
Omitting rays based on pixels with zero retardance.
For raytracing, using computing device cpu
Raytracing time in seconds: 0.07
Preparing rays for all rays at once...
Prepared geometry for all rays at once.
No radiometry provided for filtering rays.
Saving rays...
Rays saved in 0 seconds to ../reconstructions/Voxels/2025-04-27_21-08-21_Bot/config_parameters/rays.pkl
Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 3757 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 3,241
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 1,179
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 3,241
		For 2 or more rays: 3,165
Masking out voxels except for 0 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([], dtype=torch.int32)
Warning: filtered_voxels is empty. No indices to update in mask.
