Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 3757 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 3,241
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 1,961
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 3,229
		For 2 or more rays: 3,156
Masking out voxels except for 17 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([ 288,  577,  866, 1138, 1154, 1291, 1393, 1435, 1441, 1878, 2331, 2347,
