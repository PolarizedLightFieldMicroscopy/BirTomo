Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 3757 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 3,241
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 2,819
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 3,219
		For 2 or more rays: 3,138
Masking out voxels except for 40 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([1160, 1168, 1224, 1240, 1241, 1257, 1258, 1274, 1299, 1301, 1302, 1326,
