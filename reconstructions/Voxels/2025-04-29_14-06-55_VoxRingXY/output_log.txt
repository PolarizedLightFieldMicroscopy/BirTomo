Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 3757 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 3,241
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 2,437
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 3,221
		For 2 or more rays: 3,136
Masking out voxels except for 28 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([1162, 1166, 1258, 1274, 1326, 1342, 1434, 1438, 1793, 1827, 1842, 1843,
