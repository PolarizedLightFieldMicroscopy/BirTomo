Initializing a Reconstructor, using computing device cpu
Created the unique output directory reconstructions\2025-04-30_11-38-55
Omitting rays based on pixels with zero retardance.
For raytracing, using computing device cpu
Raytracing time in seconds: 0.02

Saving voxel indices by MLA index to reconstructions\2025-04-30_11-38-55\config_parameters\vox_indices_by_mla_idx.pkl
Collecting the set of voxels that are reached by the rays.
Masking out voxels except for 3 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are [np.int64(12), np.int64(37), np.int64(62)]
