Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 650547 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 588,831
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 129,100
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 581,678
		For 5 or more rays: 579,707
Masking out voxels except for 8076 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([ 7303,  7426,  7427,  7549,  7550,  7673,  7796,  7797,  7920,  8167,
