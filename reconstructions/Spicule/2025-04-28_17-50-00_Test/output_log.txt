Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 650547 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 588,831
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 588,712
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 583,018
		For 5 or more rays: 555,188
Masking out voxels except for 33532 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([ 4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
