Initializing a Reconstructor, using computing device cpu
Omitting rays based on pixels with zero retardance.
For raytracing, using computing device cpu
Raytracing time in seconds: 0.02
Preparing rays for all rays at once...
Prepared geometry for all rays at once.
No radiometry provided for filtering rays.
Saving rays...
Rays saved in 0 seconds to ../reconstructions/voxel_basic/2025-04-25_14-49-00_regularization/config_parameters/rays.pkl
Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 1183 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 266
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 34
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 263
		For 2 or more rays: 239
Masking out voxels except for 3 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([422, 591, 760], dtype=torch.int32)
Voxel mask created in 0.09 seconds
Using retardance and azimuth images for data-fidelity term.
