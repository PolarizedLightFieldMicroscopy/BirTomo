Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 1183 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 266
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 34
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 263
		For 2 or more rays: 239
Masking out voxels except for 3 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([422, 591, 760], dtype=torch.int32)
