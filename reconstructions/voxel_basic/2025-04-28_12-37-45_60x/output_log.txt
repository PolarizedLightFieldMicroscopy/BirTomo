For raytracing, using computing device cuda
Raytracing time in seconds: 0.10
Preparing rays for all rays at once...
Prepared geometry for all rays at once.
No radiometry provided for filtering rays.
Saving rays...

Setting up the voxel mask...
Identifying the voxels that are reached by the rays out of the 1183 voxels.
Number of voxels reached by the rays: 544
	Included in nonzero retardance pixels: 267
	Included in zero retardance pixels: 544
		For 2 or more rays: 532
Masking out voxels except for 0 voxels. First, at most, 20 voxels are tensor([], dtype=torch.int32)
Warning: filtered_voxels is empty. No indices to update in mask.
Voxel mask created in 0.19 seconds
Using retardance and azimuth images for data-fidelity term.
Reconstructor initialized in 0.32 seconds
